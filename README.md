Step by step battlegame. 

Feel free to add your own classes and abilities or\and change forked source code. Game is completely open-source, credits added
for fun only. 

To add class just copy one in `lib/heroes` and change stats to desired, don't forget to add entry to the top of the `main.rb` file and add your class to `lib/hero.rb`  `hero_types` method, in order to be able to choose it at the beginning of the game.

To add custom abilities or\and change existing, use methods `buffs` and `spells` in `lib/abilities.rb` as examples. Just add 
new spell to hash in likeness of existing and enjoy.
